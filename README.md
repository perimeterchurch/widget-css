## Contribution Guidelines
  1. Create a folder named for each ministry platform widget that needs custom CSS
  2. Create a file named for each rendition of the widget. For example:
     - `event-details-paid.css` is a CSS file optimized for event registrations requiring payments
     - `event-details-map.css` is a CSS file optimized for event regirstrations that require the map feature to show
  3. At the top of every file add a short comment/ description on what the purpose of the CSS file is

## Make a new link
Paste the raw link from Github to https://www.jsdelivr.com/github

## @Latest
If the page isn't updating with the proper CSS, make sure the link to the custom CSS has @latest after 'widgetcss' in the url.
